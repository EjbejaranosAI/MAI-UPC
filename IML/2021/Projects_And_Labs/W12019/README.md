# WORK 1 - CLUSTERING ALGORITHMS


## Getting started

The goal of this activity is the in-depth comprehension of some of the most well-known clustering algorithms that were discussed in class:

 * Agglomerative
 * K-Means
 * k-Modes
 * K-Prototypes
 * Fuzzy


### Installing

Python 3.6 using Anaconda and PyCharm IDE.

## Running the experiments

For running the experiments, execute the main method in class `W1/w1.py`. In this main method, the structure of particular experimentations can be defined using the `Experiment` class.

Datasets to be analyzed:

 * satimage
 * vote
 * cmc

All the available datasets are located in the `W1/resources/datasets/` folder. Different datasets can be used for the experiments by passing their names as parameters in the `Experiment` class constructor.


## Deployment
The `W1/temp/` folder should start empty.
